Deploying Node.js applications can be streamlined and made more efficient with PM2, a popular process manager. This guide will walk you through the steps of setting up and deploying a Node.js application using PM2, ensuring that you understand the context and rationale behind each action.

### Step 1: Install PM2 and dotenv

First, install PM2 and dotenv as development dependencies to manage your application processes and environment variables.

```bash
npm install --save-dev pm2 dotenv
```

Next, install PM2 globally to make it accessible from anywhere on your system.

```bash
npm install â€”global pm2
```

---

### Step 2: Setup PM2 Deployment Configuration

PM2 offers a deployment system that allows you to deploy your application to remote servers. To set up the deployment configuration for your production environment, run:

```bash
pm2 deploy production setup
```

This command creates a default configuration that you can customize for your specific needs.

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Environment variables are crucial for managing configuration settings across different environments (development, production, etc.). Create and configure a `.env` file for your server:

Navigate to your project directory and copy the example environment file to create your own:

```bash
cd /home/username/www/example.com/source
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to set your specific environment variables. You can use `vi`, `nano`, or any other text editor:

```bash
vi .env
```

Ensure that your `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive information to version control:

```plaintext
.env
```

---

### Step 4: Create .env.example

An `.env.example` file provides a template of the necessary environment variables for other developers or for setting up new environments. Hereâ€™s an example:

```markdown
# envs for your local

DEPLOY_NAME=application.backend
DEPLOY_USER=username
DEPLOY_HOST=localhost
DEPLOY_PATH=/home/username/www/example.com

# envs for your server

DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@127.0.0.1:3306/database
```

---

### Step 5: Configure PM2 Ecosystem File

The `ecosystem.config.js` file is where you define your application and deployment settings for PM2. This file can be customized to fit your deployment workflow:

```javascript
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: process.env.DEPLOY_NAME,
      script: './src/server.js',
      env: {
        COMMON_VARIABLE: 'true',
      },
      env_production: {
        NODE_ENV: 'production',
      },
    },
  ],

  deploy: {
    production: {
      user: process.env.DEPLOY_USER,
      host: process.env.DEPLOY_HOST,
      ref: 'origin/master',
      repo: 'git@github.com:username/repo.git',
      path: process.env.DEPLOY_PATH,
      'post-deploy': [
        'npm install',
        `pm2 reload ecosystem.config.js --env production --name ${process.env.DEPLOY_NAME}`,
      ].join(' && '),
    },
  },
};
```

This configuration file defines the application settings under `apps` and the deployment settings under `deploy`. The `post-deploy` section specifies commands to run after deploying, such as installing dependencies and reloading the application.

---

### Step 6: Deploy Your Application

Once everything is set up, you can deploy your application with the following command:

```bash
pm2 deploy production
```

This command uses the deployment configuration defined in your `ecosystem.config.js` to deploy your application to the production environment.
